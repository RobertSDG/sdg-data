  Natural or semi-natural sites that 'exhibit exceptional botanical richness and/or support an outstanding assemblage of rare, threatened and/or endemic plant species and/or vegetation of high botanic value'</p><p><a
  href="https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=c38f60f68f094f269d90db26b1381837">Important Bird and Biodiversity Area (IBA)</a> - 'Selected on the basis of the bird numbers and species complements they hold. IBAs are particularly important for species that congregate in large numbers,
  such as wintering and passage waterbirds and breeding seabirds. Many sites have also been identified for species of global, and European/EU conservation concern.'</p><p>Alliance for Zero Extinction sites - Sites that contain '95% or more of the remaining population of one or more species
  listed as endangered or critically endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species'. There are currently no such sites in the UK.</p><p>Protected area - Protected areas include Nature Reserves, National Parks, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), Sites of Special Scientific
  Interest (SSSI), Heritage Coast, and National Scenic Areas. For the full list of designations please see <a href="https://www.protectedplanet.net/country/GBR">Protected Planet</a>. Protected areas are taken from the World Database of Protected Areas (WDPA). Note that the data presented
  here do not include any Marine Protected Areas (MPAs).</p><p>Ecosystem type - Ecosystem type is determined using the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology's 2015 <a href="https://www.ceh.ac.uk/services/land-cover-map-2015">Land Cover Map (LCM2015)</a>. This uses satellite data to categorise
  land into land cover classes, which are further aggregated to 'aggregate classes', here referred to as Ecosystem type. Land cover classes are described in the <a href="https://data.jncc.gov.uk/data/0b7943ea-2eee-47a9-bd13-76d1d66d471f/JNCC-Report-307-SCAN-WEB.pdf">JNCC Report 307</a> and
  in the <a href="https://www.ceh.ac.uk/sites/default/files/LCM2015_Dataset_Documentation.pdf">Land Cover Map 2015 Documentation (PDF)</a>.</p><p> </p><p>The following definitions give the broad habitats included in each Ecosystem type, with notes in brackets. Where no definition is given,
  the broad habitat name is the same as the ecosystem type -</p><p>Arable - 'Arable and Horticulture'</p><p>Broadleaf woodland - 'Broadleaved, Mixed and Yew Woodland'</p><p>Coastal - 'Supra-littoral Rock', 'Littoral Rock' and 'Littoral Sediment' (including saltmarsh)</p><p>Mountain, heath,
  bog - 'Dwarf Shrub Heath' (including heather and heather grassland), 'Bog', and 'Inland Rock'.</p><p>Semi-natural grassland - 'Neutral Grassland', 'Calcareous Grassland', 'Acid Grassland', and 'Fen, Marsh and Swamp'.</p>

  <p>Average proportion of Terrestrial KBAs covered by protected areas  = sum area of KBAs of all ecosystem types except freshwater / sum area of protected areas of all ecosystrem types except freshwater *100.</p><p>No other calculations on the source data are required.
